### CT4: Naïve Bayes Model for Text Classification

In this activity, critical thinking assignment 3; we will define Naïve Bayes Model and will provide an example using the Naive Bayes model for Text Classification, Naive Bayes is a series of supervised learning algorithms which are based on the application of Baye's theorem, assuming that each pair of features, having regard to the class variable values, is conditional independence.
